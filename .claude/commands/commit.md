Create a git commit of the current working tree. Stage all changes and create a commit message following our standard rules. Do not push.  If the current repository belongs to a Bluespark project, follow our Jira issue commit message format, otherwise check for CONTRIBUTING.md and other relevant files in the repository for instructions. If none, fall back to sensible default format, like conventional commit format.

if we're on a primary branch, please create a feature branch first, again following Bluespark branch naming conventions if on a bluespark project; if otherwise, use conventional commit feature branch naming conventions, unless otherwise instructed by docs. Do not mention the internal Bluespark Jira issue when contributing to public non-Bluespark repositories.

Instruction files and docs to look for may include but are not limited to:

- CONTRIBUTING.md – general contribution guide.
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.md – issue templates (bug reports, feature requests, etc.).
- .gitlab/issue_templates/*.md
- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md – PR creation guidelines.
- .gitlab/merge_request_templates/*.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md – community/behavior expectations.
- SECURITY.md – responsible disclosure instructions.
- README.md - general project descriptions.
