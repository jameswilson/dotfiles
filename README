this is the contents of my personal ~/  folder on my development machine

It is completley customized for my development preferences:

* Mac OS X
* preferred editor: vim
* Macports is installed
* Optionally Homebrew is installed (doesnt work on PPC:(


If I'm recovering this then do the following:

1) clone this locally to the ~/ folder
2) Move .gitconfig-dist to .gitconfig
3) Copy the following section to .git/info/exclude
